# creed

## What is it?
A place where you find people who can fill in gaps in knowledge that you lack to complete a project.

## What kind of project?
I honestly don't know. Let's say your uncle Bob needs a cat themed laser show. You have just got started with lasers, but have no idea about cats or shows. This is when you come to creed. Cause obviously uncle bob's no millionaire, and you really really want to do it.

## Architecture

### Frontend: React, Recoil.js (state managment)
### Backend: Go, Graphql
### Database: Postgresql

The only things I need to learn are Go and Postgresql (no pressure)
